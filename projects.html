                     <p>My first foray into research during my last year of college. I got a taste of reading research papers for systems and benchmarks, figuring out what specific benchmarks were meant to test, then designing experiments to test precisely those things. In my case, I needed to adapt and implement Smallbank to benchmark a new distributed system against existing ones such as <a href="https://syslab.cs.washington.edu/papers/tapir-sosp15.pdf">TAPIR</a>. I learned that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4331062_The_Cost_of_Serializability_on_Platforms_That_Use_Snapshot_Isolation">Smallbank</a> was an OLTP Benchmark with realistic R/W conflicts. I designed experiments to first verify correctness of the Smallbank implementation, varying throughput and hotspot probability then checking abort rates. Verifying correctness was confusing because existing systems were benchmarked with different workloads; this meant that I couldn't just compare the raw graphs from my experiments with those of existing experiments. Thus, I had to make strong use of intuition. For instance, I had to understand that certain results were produced because Smallbank had uniquely short transactions touching few tuples.

                  <div class="modal-body">
                     <p> A more robust attempt of the <a href="http://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">Raft</a> consensus protocol compared to my first attempt in 2017, this time building a key-value store on top of it as well. This implements the entire protocol excluding cluster membership change and snapshotting. I detail interesting design decisions for the key components:
                     	<ul>
                     		<li>Leader Election: The challenge associated with leader election and maintaining authority for the leader arose due to the abundance of threads that needed to be spawned - the timeout threads for followers and candidates, and the heartbeat thread for the leader. I had to be meticulous about cancelling threads so that for instance, followers wouldn’t start an election despite hearing from the leader. Multithreaded servers also necessitated the use of locks to preserve consistency. Locks introduced overhead and programming complexity, as I reasoned about the criticial sections that modified shared server state between the threads. I also ignored (delayed) stale RPCs from older terms upon receiving them.</li>
                     		<li>Log Replication: Log replication was the most difficult part to implement because of edge cases. Since heartbeats from the leader to followers are sent via AppendEntriesRPCs and could be sent while the leader’s log is still empty, I needed a clean way for a follower to differentiate between receiving such a heartbeat, and receiving an AppendEntriesRPC adding new entries to an empty log. My solution was to factor out the case where the leader was sending a heartbeat with an empty log; then, following the rest of the Raft Figure 2 would take care of remaining inconsistencies.<br>The Raft paper states that if commitIndex &gt; lastApplied at a server, then apply the commands in the log between lastApplied and the commitIndex. Because of potential race conditions with multiple threads and to prevent blocking the server from concurrently receiving messages by applying commands with the main thread, I opted to use one dedicated thread to apply commands. This thread would wait on a condition variable that is only notified at the leader when it receives success responses for AppendEntriesRPCs and at a follower when it receives an AppendEntriesRPC. I believe that calling the application thread at these two places is appropriate because this is when either of these servers would find out that the commitIndex has changed. Calling it more frequently would be a waste of effort.</li>
                     		<li>Client Interaction: Raft dictates that all requests must go to the leader, and in the real world, the client would not know which server the leader is. Thus, the client needs to guess and sends requests to a random server. In my design, the server either sends it a redirect response, or an ACK. My client has a timeout of 1 second before retrying the request to a new, random server as it assumes that the server it previously considered to be a leader had failed. My client does not move on to the next request until it receives an ACK for the previous, sending new requests in 1 second intervals. I chose a timeout of 1 second so that the receiver socket buffers would not be overwhelmed and drop data.</li>
                     		<li>Key-Value Store: Due to the modularization of the code, the key-value store was relatively easy to add on. Each get, put, append command is embedded in its own log entry and replicated. When each server applies the commands, get commands are a no-op, puts and appends are performed in the corresponding key in my Python dictionary. The leader responds to get commands with the resulting values post-application of all previous commands, and ACKs puts and appends.</li>
                     	</ul>

                     <p>Inspired by some seniors implementing Paxos, my friends and I, as part of an attempt to learn about distributed computing, decided to implement the Raft algorithm. Raft is a distributed consensus algorithm which allows clients to connect to any server in a server cluster and update a stored value. I was a backend developer in this project, and I worked on both leader election and log replication: I setup networking between servers and debugged leader-follower communications to automate leader election.<sup>*</sup> In addition, I designed structures (deciding how to store and process the RPC requests from clients, followers, and leader) for log replication for servers to reach a consensus, and tolerate failures within the clique.
                        <br><br>
                        <sup>*</sup>The leader is the server that the client is redirected to; all client requests must go through the leader, who sends a remote procedure call (RPC) to its follows and only commits the entry to its log if the update is accepted by a majority of the followers. The leader periodically sends heartbeat RPCs to its followers, and if a leader is down, the followers and supposed to automatically re-elect a new leader, so the system can resume processing client requests as normal.

                     <p>Screensharing apps currently exist for desktop platforms but there are little to no mobile apps that allow user to share their iPhone or iPad screens in realtime. The purpose of this project is to allow users to draw on their iPhones or iPads, then <i>project</i> their drawings and diagrams onto a web app. Hopefully this will make it more convenient for students working on projects remotely (like my team) to collaborate with their peers. The end goal is to eliminate the tedious cycle of first using the camera app to take pictures of our ideas, uploading and sending them through a second app, and opening yet another app to flesh out the ideas over video chat.</p>
                     <p> I created the concept and served as project leader for Project. Using Firebase database as the backend, I configured secure data transfer from the Swift-based iOS app to a JavaScript-based web app, and set up data processing in the web app to reflect changes to a drawing in real-time.</p>

                     <p>My team and I started this project with the goal of breaking the so-called echo-chamber effect of social media. Upon logging in, the user's Facebook likes are processed, and articles appealing to the user's tastes are retrieved. With each article the user reads and rates, the more data the machine-learning model works with to fetch personalized article content.</p>
                     <p> I experienced full-stack development through this project. Using ReactJS, I managed article display, retrieval, and rating in the frontend. For the backend, I set up database models in Django and handled all interactions between backend modules, such as database queries and updating user model and keywords for machine learning. </p>

                     <p>
                        <br>My team originally comprised of my 3 developer friends and me. <em>Our interdisciplinary team of 8, consisting of 3 vet school students and 1 Masters of Engineering student - all strangers - and us, </em> came together because we were all drawn to the notion of a disease tracker for animals.<br>
                        <br>Currently, if a human patient goes into a hospital and is diagnosed with a disease, that data point is recorded and added to epidemiological databases. But in companion animal medicine in the United States, data collection is lacking. There are limited, accessible databases for some infectious diseases, reports on diseases are distributed infrequently, and for some diseases, data entry is even optional.<br>
                        <br> <em> We envisioned a software that would streamline data entry</em> (by parsing JSON) <em>and upload data points to a database on a server</em>. This <em>database would update in real-time</em>. That way, vets and researchers can easily search the database using criteria such as zip code and disease <em>to track and prevent the spread of disease</em>. Furthermore, the user can export data to CSV form, compatible, raw data for statistical analysis. Pharmaceutical companies, for example, could use this feature to develop more timely products and combat diseases quicker.<br>
                        <br> Our prototype allows data to be easily imported, exported, and searched. Unfortunately, we were not able to set up a database server to collect this data. Instead, the data imported was stored inside an ArrayList. Ideally, the data would be added to an SQL database for time-efficient and space-efficient retrieval. <em>I mainly worked on the "database": adding data, filtering searches, returning a summary of data, and updating the client's dropdown boxes programmatically based on available data.</em> <br>

                     <br> From this hackathon, I realized that engineering a product requires much much more than knowledge of programming languages and data structures. <em>Engineering first requires a vision. </em>For a majority of the time, I was extremely focused on coding to completing the product. In retrospect, a complete product is great, but only a well thought-out product will truly benefit people. That's why listening to the vet's discussions on feasibility (whether the data should be manually entered or import automatically), the business model (whether the market was the public, vets, or companies), etc. were so valuable for me. Although the hackathon was extremely draining (the developers stayed up from 10AM to 4AM the next day), I was motivated because of the vet students' passion. I originally participated in the hackathon for the experience - to challenge myself and see how quickly I could think and code in a pressurized-situation. <em>I came out of the hackathon enlightened, understanding the importance of thinking about all aspects of a product and sincerely striving to create an impact with it, not just perfecting and optimizing the technical side.</em> <br>
                     <br>My team is currently looking into ways this product can be developed further. Although unlike other hackathon projects, this project is not geared towards the general public as a market, this could be of great value to researchers. I hope that a revamped product of this kind can really be used to stop disease outbreaks and benefit animal and human lives.

                     <p>This was the first big project I worked on with very little pre-existing code to build off of. I had to write up design docs as well and learn about different design patterns as well: I designed a class hierarchy to represent an abstract syntax tree upon parsing a “critter” program; incorporated the visitor pattern for pretty-printing and “mutating” the AST; used the model-view-controller pattern to  interpret the critter language and simulate execution of critter programs. I also became interested in front-end work as I built a GUI for visualizing and changing a critter hex world using Java, and inspecting a single hex using JavaFx. The most exciting part of the project was writing a threadsafe server supporting HTTP requests from multiple GUI clients to modify the critter world via JSON objects. I was amazed when I saw changes propagate on the different clients simultaneously.</p>
