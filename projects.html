		      <div class="modal-body">
		        <p>Inspired by some seniors implementing Paxos, my friends and I, as part of an attempt to learn about distributed computing, decided to implement the Raft algorithm. Raft is a distributed consensus algorithm which allows clients to connect to any server in a server cluster and update a stored value. I was a backend developer in this project, and I worked on both leader election and log replication: I setup networking between servers and debugged leader-follower communications to automate leader election.<sup>*</sup> In addition, I designed structures (deciding how to store and process the RPC requests from clients, followers, and leader) for log replication for servers to reach a consensus, and tolerate failures within the clique.
		        <br><br>
		        <sup>*</sup>The leader is the server that the client is redirected to; all client requests must go through the leader, who sends a remote procedure call (RPC) to its follows and only commits the entry to its log if the update is accepted by a majority of the followers. The leader periodically sends heartbeat RPCs to its followers, and if a leader is down, the followers and supposed to automatically re-elect a new leader, so the system can resume processing client requests as normal.

		        <p>Screensharing apps currently exist for desktop platforms but there are little to no mobile apps that allow user to share their iPhone or iPad screens in realtime. The purpose of this project is to allow users to draw on their iPhones or iPads, then <i>project</i> their drawings and diagrams onto a web app. Hopefully this will make it more convenient for students working on projects remotely (like my team) to collaborate with their peers. The end goal is to eliminate the tedious cycle of first using the camera app to take pictures of our ideas, uploading and sending them through a second app, and opening yet another app to flesh out the ideas over video chat.</p>
		        <p> I created the concept and served as project leader for Project. Using Firebase database as the backend, I configured secure data transfer from the Swift-based iOS app to a JavaScript-based web app, and set up data processing in the web app to reflect changes to a drawing in real-time.</p>
		        <p> Check out the web app <a href="http://www.prject.co.nf/"> here</a>. Stay tuned for the release of the iOS app; in the meantime, check out some sneak peeks below! </p>

				<h2> Pawpulation </h2>
				<p> Cornell University Animal Health Hackathon | Java | Team Project  </p>
				<p> Jan 28, 2017 - Jan 29, 2017 </p>
		      </div>
		      <div class="modal-body">
		        <p> In a nutshell, I worked with a team of vets, designers, and developers to enable real-time disease surveillance and research. I created a GUI that supports searching the database, and exporting and importing data. </p>

				<p> The repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/jc2729/pawpulation/">here</a>. Read more about my experience below... </p>
				<hr style="margin-bottom:0">
				<p>
				<br>My team originally comprised of my 3 developer friends and me. <em>Our interdisciplinary team of 8, consisting of 3 vet school students and 1 Masters of Engineering student - all strangers - and us, </em> came together because we were all drawn to the notion of a disease tracker for animals.<br>

				<br>Currently, if a human patient goes into a hospital and is diagnosed with a disease, that data point is recorded and added to epidemiological databases. But in companion animal medicine in the United States, data collection is lacking. There are limited, accessible databases for some infectious diseases, reports on diseases are distributed infrequently, and for some diseases, data entry is even optional.<br>
				<br> <em> We envisioned a software that would streamline data entry</em> (by parsing JSON) <em>and upload data points to a database on a server</em>. This <em>database would update in real-time</em>. That way, vets and researchers can easily search the database using criteria such as zip code and disease <em>to track and prevent the spread of disease</em>. Furthermore, the user can export data to CSV form, compatible, raw data for statistical analysis. Pharmaceutical companies, for example, could use this feature to develop more timely products and combat diseases quicker.<br>

				<br> Our prototype allows data to be easily imported, exported, and searched. Unfortunately, we were not able to set up a database server to collect this data. Instead, the data imported was stored inside an ArrayList. Ideally, the data would be added to an SQL database for time-efficient and space-efficient retrieval. <em>I mainly worked on the "database": adding data, filtering searches, returning a summary of data, and updating the client's dropdown boxes programmatically based on available data.</em> <br>
				<div style="text-align: center;">

				<img src="assets/animal_health_hackathon_ss/results.png" alt="Results Page" width="40%">
				</div>
				<br> From this hackathon, I realized that engineering a product requires much much more than knowledge of programming languages and data structures. <em>Engineering first requires a vision. </em>For a majority of the time, I was extremely focused on coding to completing the product. In retrospect, a complete product is great, but only a well thought-out product will truly benefit people. That's why listening to the vet's discussions on feasibility (whether the data should be manually entered or import automatically), the business model (whether the market was the public, vets, or companies), etc. were so valuable for me. Although the hackathon was extremely draining (the developers stayed up from 10AM to 4AM the next day), I was motivated because of the vet students' passion. I originally participated in the hackathon for the experience - to challenge myself and see how quickly I could think and code in a pressurized-situation. <em>I came out of the hackathon enlightened, understanding the importance of thinking about all aspects of a product and sincerely striving to create an impact with it, not just perfecting and optimizing the technical side.</em> <br>

				<br>My team is currently looking into ways this product can be developed further. Although unlike other hackathon projects, this project is not geared towards the general public as a market, this could be of great value to researchers. I hope that a revamped product of this kind can really be used to stop disease outbreaks and benefit animal and human lives.

				<h2> Critter Simulation </h2>

				<p> Oct 2016 - Dec 2016</p>
		      </div>
		      <div class="modal-body">
		        <p>This was the first big project I worked on with very little pre-existing code to build off of. I had to write up design docs as well and learn about different design patterns as well: I designed a class hierarchy to represent an abstract syntax tree upon parsing a “critter” program; incorporated the visitor pattern for pretty-printing and “mutating” the AST; used the model-view-controller pattern to  interpret the critter language and simulate execution of critter programs. I also became interested in front-end work as I built a GUI for visualizing and changing a critter hex world using Java, and inspecting a single hex using JavaFx. The most exciting part of the project was writing a threadsafe server supporting HTTP requests from multiple GUI clients to modify the critter world via JSON objects. I was amazed when I saw changes propagate on the different clients simultaneously.</p>
